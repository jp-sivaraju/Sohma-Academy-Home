                  Back in 2016, when technology was largely very complex. Due created a 
                  program - Robotics In Academics - that aim to bring the technology to 
                  school students. The program was named then as a part of Telangana has 
                  very Bharat. After couple of years of teaching at the NITI aayog, which 
                  allowed us to understand the market better, we recognized that there was 
                  market growth potential. Students wanted to learn something new, designing 
                  and executing electronics projects or embedded systems implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After our schools, and therefore our kids, opened to the 
                  opportunities of what's possible in today's technological landscape. In 
                  2019, we formed "a path to Sohan Roos. Although Soham can give the 
                  teachers in rural schools that they should also have access to their 
                  education systems and digital systems. So we want students to continue 
                  learning something new. Teaching children via art, online games skills.
